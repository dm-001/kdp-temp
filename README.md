# The German Communist Party and the rise of the Nazis

> Worker-Communists, you are hundreds of thousands, millions; you cannot leave for anyplace; there are not enough passports for you. Should fascism come to power, it will ride over your skulls and spines like a terrific tank. Your salvation lies in merciless struggle. And only a fighting unity with the Social Democratic workers can bring victory. Make haste, worker-Communists, you have very little time left! \
*Trotsky, For a workers united front against fascism, 1931*

> After Hitler, our turn! \
*Ernst Thälmann, KPD, 1931* 


- 1933 January 30 - Hitler appointed as chancellor
- Feb 27th - Burning of the Reichstag, KPD paper banned, 
in the week to follow key civil liberties suspended, KPD banned outright, mass arrests. 
- May 2 - SPD deputies and organisations met the same fate. 


## Intro:

- Nazi Party and Fascism in Germany is the best-known example of a fascist movement and fascist state in last century
- Prior to the rise of the Nazis, Germany was known for a different reason - it's workers movement
- Obvious question is posed - How did the fascist rise to power and defeat the famous German worker's movement and it's mass parties, in particular the KPD.

I reckon answering that question means understanding three things -
1. The years of ongoing instability and crisis, economic and political, that defined Germany post WW1
2. The Germany workers movement, in particular the Communist Party (KPD) that emerged after 1917 and its nature and limitations, it's positioning and orientation
3. The defeat of the Russian revolution and the consolidation of the new Stalist ruling class in Russia and what that meant for the German KPD and the Communist Parties of the world

All three impact on one another, and together can illuminate how the Nazi party can go from the beer hall putch to state power while the KPD seemingly does it's best to not fight back.
Also provides the broader context to explain the disasterous approach the KPD took to the rise of the Nazi party and to fascism in Germany.


## What led to rise of fascism in Germany?

- Years and years of crisis and instability

- WW1, ended by revolution

- Revolution, ended by reformism/SPD

- Ruling class holds on through 1918, and 20s with the help of SPD

- German ruling class never able to fully stabilise things - constant class battles.

- Weimar Republic as the result of compromises the ruling class forced to give for stability

- 1930ish - great depression excellerates it all

### Ruling class and SPD throughout

- Only thing German ruling class cared about was restabilising their rule, restoring profitability and 'competetiveness' of german capitalism.

- 1918, 1919, most of 20s they generally saw that frontal assault on entire class was unlikely to end well. Relied on SPD to stabilise things, prevent revolutionary challenges, reinforce public support for capitalist state.

- Ruling class resented every concession. Wiemar replublic referred to with disgust as 'trade union state' when talking among themselves.

- SPD very happy to identify themselves with the Wiemar replublic, key factor in how this unstable compromise managed to exist for as long as it did.

- Great depression makes that unstable setup even less stable.

- Mass unemployment, hyperinflation. Millions of people see the Weimar republic offering nothing, crumbling. Faith in the Weimar republic was falling rapidly

- SPD as largest working class organisation remains bound up with an identified with the bourgois government and positions as *the* defenders of constitutional order

- Once nazis had proved themselves useful sections of the ruling class were prepared to back them if it meant a decisive blow against the workers movement

### So - what led the KPD to it's rotten positioning?

- History of the KPD is complex - but it's one of opportunities both taken and missed

- Party was formed in the heat of class battles, after the SPDs historic betrayal

- Key question for revolutionary movement was the SPD and reformism: elaborate

- Early KPD leaders murdered, subsequent leaders tested quickly and often harshly, often reliant on comintern (both good and bad)

- Took some years to establish a serious political baseline, get some agreement on key questions nad tasks, get to a point where they could built on a serious basis

- Importantly - The stabilisation of the party leadership throughout 1920s coincides with the degeneration of the comintern and the consolidation of stalinism. By the late 20s Thalmann and co represented a number of things - but obedience to and reliance on comintern was a big one.

- Internal life of the KDP also degenerated through the late 20s - in comintern mold no internal debate etc.


### The comintern and the Third Period:

- Quote comintern motion re: final phase etc

- New era of revolutionary struggles, unsolvable 'final' crisis of capitalism

- Communists must stand firm and drive out any talk of partial or defensive struggle etc

- Notably: A political shift based primarily off what was useful in the consolidation of the regime in russia

- Quote from how workers took power re: Offensive in russia against bukharin, forced-pace industrialisation etc as aim of 'third period' internally

- Imposed internationally to disasterous effect - with Germany as the most disasterous - also where a very superficial reading was most believable (re SPD, ruling class more and more willing to trade everything to regain stability)

## What was the KPD approach -


- Third Period (i.e. "final period of capitalism” - elaborate a bit)

- Social fascists and 'left' social fascists - Stalin’s dictum that fascism and social democracy were “twin brothers”

> Fascism is the bourgeoisie’s fighting organisation that relies on the active support of Social-Democracy. Social-Democracy is objectively the moderate wing of fascism. \
*Stalin, 1924*

> In this situation of growing imperialist contradiction and sharpening of the class struggle, fascism becomes more and more the dominant method of bourgeois rule. In countries where there are strong social-democratic parties, fascism assumes the particular form of social-fascism, which to an ever-increasing extent serves the bourgeoisie as an instrument for paralysing the masses in struggle against the regime of fascist dictatorship. \
> *MolotoTenth plenum ofv,  the Comintern executive, July 1929*

- A mix of either ignoring and downplaying the threat of the growing fascist organisations - after all everyone is a fascist so what's so special about hitler, and at other times partly siding with the fascists against the SPD (i.e. the 1931 'Red Referrendum' / Landtag referrendum)

- SPD, for it's part, were similarly happy to state that there was no difference between the Nazis and the Communists. The SPD leadership was deeply committed to the weimar state, and deeply identified with it. To them the KPD and Nazis were both opponents of the republic.


## The obvious critique of the KPD line

- Fascism, when organised and confident, is a very direct threat to the working class.

- Not just a pro-capitalist formation - but one that seeks to decisively smash to workers movement and break apart and atomise the entire working class, and coheres an enraged mix of middle class and lumpenised elements to do it.

> From fascism the bourgeoisie demands a thorough job; once it has resorted to methods of civil war, it insists on having peace for a period of years. And the fascist agency, by utilizing the petty bourgeoisie as a battering ram, by overwhelming all obstacles in its path, does a thorough job. \
... \
the workers’ organizations are annihilated; that the proletariat is reduced to an amorphous state; and that a system of administration is created which penetrates deeply into the masses and which serves to frustrate the independent crystallization of the proletariat \
*Trotsky, What Next? Vital Question for the German Proletariat, 1932*

## Trotsky and the United Front

- Though the fascists were growing fast the German working class parties were still decisively larger, with a proud history.

- KPD memberships moves about, but 100k - 300k. 2-6 million votes.
- SPD membership - Millions. Papers and deputies and all the rest.
- On the eve of the Nazi victory the workers parties could still get 50% of national vote

- Working class had the strength and organisation to defeat the threat - but weren't ever allowed to seriously try due to politics of KPD and SPD

- There was resistance to the fascists
  - KPD members fought them, defended their meetings and orgs etc
  - SPD Iron Front (block with the 'constitutional bourgeois') led to armed workers organising
  
- But - Needed a determined national response. Things were far beyond the point where the threat could be countered by semi-spontaneous local actions etc

- Trotsky's argument was for united front - joint action to defeat the fascists that threatened both KPD and SPD and entire class.

> A cattle dealer once drove some bulls to the slaughterhouse. And the butcher came nigh with his sharp knife.

>>“Let us close ranks and jack up this executioner on our horns,” suggested one of the bulls. \
>>“If you please, in what way is the butcher any worse than the dealer who drove us hither with his cudgel?” replied the bulls, who had received their political education in [the comintern] \
>>“But we shall be able to attend to the dealer as well afterwards!” \
>>“Nothing doing,” replied the bulls firm in their principles, to the counselor. “You are trying, from the left, to shield our enemies – you are a social-butcher yourself.”

>And they refused to close ranks. \
*'An Aesop Fable' (What Next? Vital Question for the German Proletariat, 1932*


## United front in more detail:

- A strategy to organise a defensive fight against the snowballing fascists
- Meet each fascist attack with the overwhelming numbers and combined strength of the workers movement. Prevent the facists gaining momentum. In the process build the confidence of the working class.

- Importantly - also a strategy to win the best workers to the KPD

- United front often spoken of in vague terms as the politics of 'let's all work together and forget our differences' - not the case

- A strategy designed to push the nazis back, but also one designed to make clear that only the revolutionaries were prepared to do what was needed to win that fight.

- United front as a strategy for a mass rev party to potentially break the better workers from the reformists


## Summing up

- The rise of Fascism in Germany was never a sure thing - Right up until the last moments the german working class had the power and potential to stop them

- The problem was, as you'd expect, a political one. 

    - SPD gave endless ground to the Nazis and cautioned the workers not to be too bold, lest they scare the 'democratic' bits of the ruling class and state.
    *But this is the expected behaviour of reformists*

    - KPD position was less simple to understand - their mix of accomodation and abstention made a noose for their own necks. However it can be explained if the KPD is situated in the broader communist movement and the stalinisation of the comintern and local parties. 

      Perfect storm of manouvreing of the stalinist ruling class to consolidate power internally in russia leading to the insanity of the 'third period' being imposed and used as a loyalty test in Germany, and a communist party whose leadership were keen to defer to the comintern for years - but by the late 20s had been forged to be loyal to the comintern.

- Was always an alternative strategy, summed up in the United Front. A strategy not just to push the fascists back, but also to break the most militant workers from the dead-end reformism of the SPD and cohere a working-class alternative the endless crisis and horror of Germany capitalism.
